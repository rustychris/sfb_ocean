Stormwater:
  Probably just treat all stormwater the same?
  Or is it not too hard to normalize the samples by relative flow?

The stormwater inflows in the model are:
  COYOTE
  NAPA
  SCLARAVCc (Guad River / Alviso Slough)
  UALAMEDA (Alameda flood control)

Stormwater measurements do not include Alameda Flood control or Napa, but do include
a number of smaller creeks and sub-watersheds.

Chapter has the sample volume (liters) per site.

Estimate that 74% of particles are from industrial areas which in turn make
up only 6% of the land area.

Overall, 1.3 -- 30 particles/L observed.

Report also gives coefficients for land type to particle count.
i.e. a watershed that's 100% industrial is estimated to have 62 particles/L,
but if it's 60% industrial 40% residential, then it would be 0.60*62 + 0.40*1.0.
There is an assumption in there that flow and particle count scale in the same
way with watershed area.  Fine.

SFEI does put some 2005 ABAG land-use GIS data online.  That includes polygon layers
with a Land_use_classification field, that is similar but a bit finer than the
report.  It has Agriculture, Commercial - {high,low}, Industrial, Null, Open( - compacted)?
Residential - {high,low,med,rural}, Transportation, Water, Water - runoff, other.
